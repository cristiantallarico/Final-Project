Readme.md file to my final project

This is a 3x3 animal themed slotmachine game which lets the user input a starting bet on a maximum of 3 lines.

I imported the random module to create a random spin for the slot machine and used the emojisense extention to get my symbols

A simple way to run this code on your machine is to copy and paste it into your own editor 
I hope you have fun playing around with it.

(I do not encourage gambling in any sense with this project)
